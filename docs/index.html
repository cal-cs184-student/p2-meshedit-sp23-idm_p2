<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
    A Bezier curve is a parametric curve that is defined by a set of control points.
    By creating a blending function, we can create the Bezier curve by utilizing the given control points.
    De Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive algorithm used to evaluate Bezier curves.
    The de Casteljau's algorithm works by calculating the next step's control points of the curve by a certain point t [0 - 1].
    This is done recursively until we just get our final single points.
    The end result is the point on the Bezier curve that corresponds to the parameter t.
    In this assignment, we implement a function named <b>evaluateStep</b>. The function's initial parameters are  a set of control points
    and a value of t. We can then split the control points into two groups at t and apply the algorithm recursively to each group.
    We keep splitting and applying the algorithm until we get the final point on the Bezier curve that corresponds to t. The vector calculation
    is based on <b>CGL vectors library</b>.
</p>

<b>
  Take a look at the provided .bzc files and create your own Bezier curve with 6 control points of your choosing. Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    The algorithm for evaluating a Bezier surface is similar to the algorithm for evaluating a Bezier curve.
    The main difference is that instead of linearly blending between adjacent control points,
    we blend between control points along both the u and v directions of the surface. That means we first do one dimension Bezier curve
    evaluation using parameter u for each row, then we use the points generated from each row to run the de Casteljau algorithm based
    on parameter v.
    How we implement it: We first change our part one function from 2D to 3D, then we run the function recursively until it provides us
    with a single point. Finally, we leverage n single points (generated from n rows) and do the calculation again.
